Throughout the ACM UWB Hackathon, there will be several
workshops put on by your favorite school clubs! Attending these
workshops are optional, but highly recommended.

# GrayHats Workshop

12:45 :: North Creek Events Center, UWB :: May 25th

[GrayHat Workshop Materials][grayhats-workshop]

The GrayHats bot workshop will be two parts.

The first part is a Discord bot that focuses on the reconnaissance of domains and servers.
The bot provides functionality to determine the domain owner, location, server info, and checks if it's up.
Some important concepts utilized by the bot are asynchronous I/O for improved responsiveness, interaction with JSON apis, and utilizing external utilities in a safe manner.

The second part is a slack bot used to remotely control a compromised computer. While having a focus on cybersecurity, both bots use concepts that can be applied anywhere.

# Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Workshop

14:30 :: North Creek Events Center, UWB :: May 25th

The Cryptocurrency & Blockchain Club workshop will go over the basics of blockchain, Ethereum, and the Solidity programming language.

They can then build an interactive lottery smart contract.
The club looks forward to giving people an opportunity to learn about blockchain!
