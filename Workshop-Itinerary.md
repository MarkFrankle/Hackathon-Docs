The Grayhats bot workshop will be two parts. The first part is a discord bot that focuses on reconnaissance of domains. The bot provides functionality to determine the domain owner, location, server info, and checks if its up. Some important concepts utilized by the bot are asynchronous IO for improved responsiveness, interaction with JSON apis, and utilizing external utilities in a safe manner. The second part is a slack bot used to remotely control a compromised computer. While having a focus on cybersecurity, both bots use concepts that can be applied anywhere.

# Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Workshop

The Cryptocurrency & Blockchain Club workshop will go over the basics of blockchain, Ethereum, and the Solidity programming language. Participants will learn what a blockchain is and why itâ€™s useful. They can then build a lottery smart contract that is interactive. The club looks forward to giving people an opportunity to learn about blockchain!
